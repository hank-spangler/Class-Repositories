# Class Repositories

This document, and the file that you will be editing – **index.md** – are written in a [markup language][markup] called [Markdown][markdown]. The language is a superset of HTML (the language for creating web pages) that is easier to write and read. You can use HTML in a Markdown file. HTML code is enclosed in angle brackets (**&lt;** and **&gt;**).

Check out what happens when you click on the text "1st Block" below. You'll be adding to a similar section of code in **index.md**.

You will be adding your GitHub repository to the list. To do this add a line for yourself, in **alphabetical order by last name**. In the code above:

* An asterisk (__*__) at the beginning of a line creates a bulleted list item.
* Links consist of the clickable text inside of square brackets ([ and ]). The URL (the web address that the link takes you to is in parentheses imediately after the square brackets.
